<h3><font color="993399"> Work Experience </font> </h3>
<b><font color="993333">Bioinformatics Programmer &ndash; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX</font></b> Sep 2009 &ndash; Dec 2011 <br/><br/>
Baylor College of Medicine specializes in  solving critical problems in human biology and diseases. Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC)  at BCM is the <b><font color="cc6633">third largest  genomic  data production centeri</font></b>. Bioinformatics teams develop software solutions for generation and analysis of the genomic data.
<br/><br/>
Achievements
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Architected and developed an automatic<font color="cc6633"> software pipeline for Illumina DNA sequencers</font> using Java and Ruby. Over 90% of the data produced at HGSC is by this pipeline <a href="https://github.com/nirav99/Illumina-Pipeline-V2"> Illumina Pipeline Version 2 </a>
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<font color="cc6633">Reduced processing times by 20%</font> by decreasing job waiting times in the cluster, reducing I/O operations and utilizing the hardware resources and software components efficiently
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Collaborated with biologists to develop <font color="#cc6633"> genomic data analysis applications</font> that could handle <font color="cc6633"> large data</font> using Java, e.g. Sequence quality estimation, alignment quality estimation, data semantics validation etc.
</li>

<b><font color="993333">Research Software Development Engineer / Software Design Engineer in Test &ndash; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA</font> </b> Jun 2005 &ndash; Jul 2009 <br/><br/>
<font color="#cc6633">Response Point Project</font> <br/>
Response Point system  serves as a VoIP PBX and an automated receptionist for small businesses. This project evolved from a research incubation  prototype to a product.  Implemented in  C++, it  utilizes technologies such as computer-telephony integration, speech recognition, text-to-speechi and VoIP.<br/><br/>
Achievements
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Invented an <font color="#cc6633"> automatic echo-detection algorithm</font> for VoIP calls and implemented it in C# to improve audio quality in the system. Filed <font color="cc6633">two patents</font> based on this work.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Enabled Microsoft&rsquo;s partners to quantitatively test Analog Telephony Adaptors in terms of audio quality and reliability by developing a dedicated C# application. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Verified system&rsquo;s inter-operability with VoIP service partners at SIP/RTP protocol level.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Increased automated test case development efficiency by designing common libraries in C#.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Improved the product quality through regular collaboration with partners and customers.
</li>
<br/>
</ul>
<font color="#cc6633">Virtual Earth Project </font> <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps"> www.bing.com/maps </a><br/>
Virtual Earth provides the road, aerial, hybrid and oblique images across the U.S. and the other countries. It also provides a collection of rich feature set such as local search and driving directions.
<br/><br/>
Achievements
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Developed tools in C# and C++ for load / stress testing of the image servers. These tests helped to find problems such as memory leaks and file handle leaks in the system.
</li>
<br/>
